Defining pizza, the image in the post takes its thickness as 'a' and radius 
as 'z' to declare its 'volume' to be '&#928z<sup>2</sup>a', which 
translates to 'pi-zz-a'. 
If you look closely this formula appears to be a rip-off of the volume 
formula for cylinder shape. For the unitiated, there are different volume 
formulas for various geometric figures,cylinder is '&#928r<sup>2</sup>h' ,
where in 'r' is radius of circle base and 'h' is height.
