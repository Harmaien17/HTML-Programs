Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, 
flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, 
cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, 
mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, etc.), which is then 
baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.

The term pizza was first recorded in the year 997, in a Latin 
manuscript from the southern. Italian town of Gaeta, in Lazio, 
on the border with Campania. Raffaele Esposito is often 
credited for creating modern pizza in Naples. In 2009, Neapolitan 
pizza was registered with the European Union as a traditional 
speciality guaranteed dish.
