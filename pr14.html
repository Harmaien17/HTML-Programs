PIZZA:</u></font><font size=5 face="garamond">
Dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough 
topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella 
or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly usually, in a 
commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature
and served hot.
One of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita, which is topped 
with tomatoes or tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Popular legend relates that 
it was named for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was said to have 
liked its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its topping colours-green, 
white, and red were those of the Italian flag.
